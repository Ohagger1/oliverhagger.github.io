        <h1>Making Research Move: A Step-by-Step Guide to Spinning Academic Posters</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> <em>December 3, 2024</em></p>
        <p>Presenting academic research at conferences is a staple in the journey of any researcher, but making your work stand out can be a challenge. At my recent conference, I wanted to take this challenge head-on. So, I created something a bit unconventional: a spinning academic poster. The result? Not only did I capture the attention of my peers, but I also won a poster prize for my efforts.</p>
        <h2>The Idea: A New Take on the Traditional Poster</h2>
        <p>Academic posters typically follow a simple format: static, two-dimensional, and often confined to a few key sections of a researcher's work. While effective, they can lack engagement, especially in a room full of similar posters. I wanted to find a way to give my research a more dynamic presence. Inspired by manual spinning posters seen at other conferences, I wanted to take it a step further and add an element of movement. The solution? A rotating or "spinning" poster.</p> 
        <h3>Building the Spinning Poster</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Poster Design:</strong> A traditional academic poster with sections like Introduction, Methodology, Results, and Conclusion. The content was standard, but the presentation was anything but.</li>
            <li><strong>The Spinning Mechanism:</strong> A Raspberry Pi controlled a motor mounted on the poster's frame. It rotated the poster slowly for readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> A portable power bank ensured the motor ran throughout the conference.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> A 3D-printed frame held everything togetherâ€”light, sturdy, and portable.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Rotation speed was fine-tuned to balance readability and dynamism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After assembly, the poster rotated smoothly and reliably without distracting noise.</p>
        <h2>The Conference: The Big Reveal</h2>
        <p>At the conference, the spinning poster immediately grabbed attention. People stopped, took pictures, and engaged in conversations about my research. It was clear that the motion added a unique, interactive element.</p>
        <h2>The Prize: Recognition of Creativity</h2>
        <p>The positive response from attendees and judges led to a poster prize. The innovation reflected my ability to combine technical ingenuity with research communication, enhancing engagement and visibility.</p>
        <h2>Lessons Learned and Future Plans</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Creativity and innovation can elevate academic presentations.</li>
            <li>Engaging audiences beyond just presenting data is crucial.</li>
            <li>Future plans include exploring augmented reality or interactive interfaces.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This experience reaffirmed that thinking outside the box can make research presentations memorable and rewarding.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Creating a spinning academic poster was challenging but rewarding. It enhanced my research presentation and resulted in a poster prize. Innovation and creativity have a place in academia, and sometimes taking risks can lead to amazing rewards.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Making Research Move: A Step-by-Step Guide to Spinning Academic Posters</h1>


<main>
  <p>Presenting academic research at conferences is a staple in the journey of any researcher, but making your work stand out can be a challenge. At my recent conference, I wanted to take this challenge head-on. So, I created something a bit unconventional: a spinning academic poster. The result? Not only did I capture the attention of my peers, but I also won a poster prize for my efforts.</p>
  <p>Here's how I brought the spinning poster concept to life, the challenges I faced, and how it led to success.</p>

  <h2>The Idea: A New Take on the Traditional Poster</h2>
  <p>Academic posters typically follow a simple format: static, two-dimensional, and often confined to a few key sections of a researcher's work. While effective, they can lack engagement, especially in a room full of similar posters. I wanted to find a way to give my research a more dynamic presence.</p>
  <p>The solution? A rotating or "spinning" poster. Inspired by manual spinning posters which have cropped up at various conferences across the world recently, I wanted to take this one step further. I decided to add an element of movement.</p>

  <h3>1. The Poster Design</h3>
  <p>The first challenge was to design a poster that incorporated a rotating section. This required two separate layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Outer Poster:</strong> The top layer with a cut-out section to frame the rotating element.</li>
    <li><strong>The Rotating Poster:</strong> Positioned behind the top layer, it featured four distinct panels to showcase different parts of the research.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To ensure smooth rotation, the circular rotating section had to fit entirely within the boundaries of the outer poster. Each of the four panels was arranged at 90-degree angles to avoid overlap. This setup allowed viewers to see one scene at a time.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/poster_rot.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic; color: gray;">Gear Motor Version 1, 2024</p>
  <p>For structural support, I experimented with materials like cardboard and plastic sheets but ultimately adopted a design inspired by kites. Four rods connected to a central hub provided stability without compromising mobility. To further enhance the structure, I 3D-printed a loop component that was attached to the edge of the spinning poster. This loop allowed the rods to slot through and connect seamlessly to the central hub, ensuring a secure and stable framework while maintaining smooth rotational movement.</p>

  <h3>2. The Motor and Encoder</h3>
  <p>Initially, my idea was straightforward: attach a small motor to the centre of the rotating section of the poster, with some form of support to stabilise it. My first choice was a 5V stepper motor (28BYJ-48) with a ULN2003 driver board. To control the motor, I used an Arduino R4 WiFi for precise positioning. The Stepper Motor library from Arduino provided smooth movement during early testing.</p>
  <p>However, this motor lacked the torque to rotate the poster. Upgrading to a NEMA17 stepper motor offered more power but introduced a new challenge:</p>
  <p>Voltage Limitations: Most poster symposiums lack mains power, so I had to rely on a portable power bank. While many power banks supply only 5V, I sourced one with a 12V output, which provided sufficient torque but caused the motor and driver board to overheat, posing a potential fire hazard. Due to safety regulations, I reverted to a 5V power supply to eliminate overheating risks.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/87bfa80f-04d4-4ff2-b278-c4c0ebb3b18e.PNG" alt="Descriptive alt text" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic; color: gray;">Gear Motor Version 1, 2024</p>
  <p>To compensate for the lower voltage, I designed and 3D-printed a 5:1 planetary gearbox. This significantly increased the torque output of the NEMA17 motor while maintaining a compact design, ensuring reliable operation within the safety and power constraints.</p>

  <h3>The final motor setup included:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>A NEMA17 stepper motor with the custom 3D-printed gearbox.</li>
    <li>An Arduino R4 WIFI with an Arduino motor shield.</li>
    <li>An Ansmann PB212 10,000mAh power bank with dual USB outlets: one powering the motor and the other a small 40 x 40 mm cooling fan for the Arduino board and motor shield.</li>
    <li>A custom case for the Arduino, designed to house the 40 x 40 mm fan and ensure proper airflow.</li>
  </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic; color: gray;">Gear Motor Version 1, 2024</p>

  <p>The speed and delay were adjusted to ensure the movement was slow enough for viewers to read the text but fast enough to maintain a dynamic visual element. Additionally, the step movement was modified from 250 to 267 to overcome the friction between the two posters. With this setup, the motor could smoothly rotate the poster using a simple control loop:</p>

  <h3>3. The Final Poster</h3>
  <p>Before the conference, I rehearsed the setup on a poster board, which allowed me to make final adjustments. The gearbox featured three holes through which I inserted screws secured with nuts. These protruding screws served as pins to connect to the spinning poster element, enabling movement without causing damage.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic; color: gray;">Gear Motor Version 1, 2024</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic; color: gray;">Gear Motor Version 1, 2024</p>
  
  <p>For the final assembly, I 3D-printed a front and a back central panel. The front panel featured holes to accommodate the motor screws, while the back panel included additional holes to secure the rods, ensuring the poster's structural integrity.</p>
  <p>The final step involved attaching the poster, along with the geared motor, power bank, and Arduino, to the poster board. To achieve this, VELCRO Industrial Strength Hook & Loop Self-Adhesive Sticky Coins were used.</p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned and Future Plans</h2>
  <p>Clearly, this setup is far from perfect, with room for improvement in all aspects. However, given the time constraints, it was an innovative solution that successfully stood out and captured attention.</p>
